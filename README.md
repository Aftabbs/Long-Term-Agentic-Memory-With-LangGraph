This project explores the integration and evaluation of **semantic**, **episodic**, and **procedural memory** in autonomous agents using the LangGraph framework. We begin with a baseline email-handling agent and progressively enhance it with structured memory components to assess their impact on agent performance and decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To **experimentally validate** how various memory typesâ€”semantic, episodic, and proceduralâ€”affect the behavior and efficiency of an autonomous agent. We aim to simulate cognitive architectures for memory modeling in AI, specifically within the context of a **long-term memory-enabled email assistant**.

## ðŸ§± Memory Architecture

1. **Semantic Memory**
   Stores structured knowledge (facts, concepts, context-free data).
   â†’ Example: "John is a client from NY."

2. **Episodic Memory**
   Logs past experiences or interactions, time-stamped and context-bound.
   â†’ Example: "John emailed about a billing issue on 2024-05-22."

3. **Procedural Memory**
   Encodes *how to do* thingsâ€”agent's skills, routines, and task workflows.
   â†’ Example: "When encountering a billing issue, forward to [finance@company.com](mailto:finance@company.com)."

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Setup

We started with a **baseline email agent** performing actions like reading, summarizing, and responding to emails. Memory layers were added incrementally to this base agent:

* **Baseline**: No memory
* **+ Semantic Memory**
* **+ Semantic + Episodic Memory**
* **+ Semantic + Episodic + Procedural Memory**

##  Tech Stack

| Component             | Version |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| `langchain`           | 0.3.18  |
| `langgraph`           | 0.2.72  |
| `langmem`             | 0.0.8   |
| `langchain-openai`    | 0.3.5   |
| `langchain-anthropic` | 0.3.7   |

Used LangGraph for agentic flow construction, LangChain for LLM integration, and LangMem for custom memory backends.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

Each version of the agent was evaluated based on:

* **Memory Recall**: Accuracy of information retrieval
* **Context Awareness**: Ability to use memory for relevant actions
* **Task Completion Time**: Speed and efficiency
* **Interaction Coherence**: Smoothness and correctness of conversations

---

##  Key Learnings

* **Semantic memory** enhanced fact-based decision making.
* **Episodic memory** improved context retention over multiple turns.
* **Procedural memory** enabled learned routines for faster execution and reduced error.
* The layered memory approach reflects real-world cognitive systems and offers modular flexibility.

---

##  Future Work

* Fine-tuning memory decay and retrieval strategies.
* Multi-agent memory sharing.
* Integration with vector databases for large-scale semantic memory.
